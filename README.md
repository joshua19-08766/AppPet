# PET LIST APP
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Pets, like humans, also need to be consulted by a veterinarian every once in a while.
They also need their health checked professionally, whether it be their physical, mental or
social health because, like us, they can also face problems with it. They can also face issues
and complications as serious as humans do, such as skin conditions, stomach issues and ear
infections which is why a veterinary visit is always necessary for a pet and their owners.
However, some pet owners tend to forget the veterinary appointments for their pets. Even if
they write down the appointment schedule on a piece of paper, it might get lost or misplaced.
The pet list application is an excellent solution to this issue. The pet owner can use the
application to set the date of the appointment on their mobile phones. Aside from that,
information about the pet can be saved. The app would be especially useful for pet owners
who have a large number of pets. Specifically, animal shelters can benefit from this
application to monitor the vaccination date of each pets. 

## OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the application is to develop an app that will accordingly display
the list of pets. Specifically, it aims to:
- Enable user to add new pet on the list.
- Provide an appropriate vaccination date entered by the user.
- Display gender and breed of the pet through option buttons.
- Enable user to delete the pet from the list.
- Enable user to sign in with account. 

## PLANNING PHASE
This place includes the addressing the applicationâ€™s goal, integrate ideas about the
application and outline the overall concept for the app.
## DESIGINING PHASE

After planning, the team members analyzed the gathered data and sketch the visual
look of the application. The application design also includes defining necessary
requirements that will aid in the construction of the app and satisfaction of the specified
requirements.

## DEVELOPMENT PHASE
This phase focuses on application coding. The team intended to make the
application's graphical user interface user-friendly and simple to use.

## TESTING PHASE
Following the development phase's coding, the team run a series of tests to ensure
that the code is well-structured and bug-free.

## DEPLOYMENT PHASE
This phase will determine whether the project has passed the testing phase and is
ready to be used by the user.

## REVIEW PHASE
During this phase, the team intends to monitor or review any issues or problems that
may arise on the mobile application.

## LAUNCHING PHASE
The mobile application will be made available for users in order to access and use
the app after testing.
